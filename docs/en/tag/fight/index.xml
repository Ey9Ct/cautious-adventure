For example, personal problems may be relationships with partners, family problems, finances, work drama (in the office) or even more severe problems with the state, politics and the military. Basically the problems we face will lead us to choices to find solutions and resolutions. The severity of the problem and the available opportunities will affect the possible number of choices that can be made.</description></item></channel></rss>
