All history is contemporary history â€” Benedetto Croce
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto Croce, &amp;ldquo;All history is contemporary history&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
